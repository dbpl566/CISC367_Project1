# These scripts take disentangled Slack chat conversations from a .csv file, analyze it for a chosen characteristic, and write it out to a spreadsheet.

# input_file.py reads in the .csv file and extracts the data
# analysis.py performs the necessary calculations to analyze the data for the number of URLs included in the chats
# driver.py calls both the input_file.py and the analysis.py and writes the data out to a spreadsheet
